## 💼 Research & Professional Experience

### **AI Researcher Intern – Polytechnique Montréal, Canada**  
**May 2024 – Dec 2024**  
Research-focused project on detecting semantic code clones (Type-4) using NLP, embeddings, and vector databases.

Contributions:

-Data Preparation & Cleaning: Processed large-scale datasets (POJ104, BigCloneBench, Google Code Jam, CodeNet) to extract and normalize code functions.

-Pipeline Development: Built a data ingestion pipeline capable of handling millions of code samples with batch processing for scalability.

-Embeddings Generation: Leveraged Sentence Transformers to generate high-dimensional vector representations of source code.

-Vector Database Integration: Designed and implemented similarity search with Qdrant, including collection setup, batching, and query optimization.

-Evaluation & Experiments: Compared the performance of vector database approaches vs. deep learning models (accuracy, recall, scalability).

Performance Optimization: Addressed challenges like vector dimension mismatches, memory bottlenecks, and computational efficiency.

-Semantic Clone Detection: Focused on cross-language clone detection, going beyond syntactic similarity to capture deeper semantic relationships.

-Research Contribution: Defined research questions around effectiveness, performance, and scalability of embedding-based approaches, providing insights for future academic publications.

💡 Impact: Showcased how vector database–based methods can serve as a lightweight, scalable alternative to neural network approaches for clone detection, paving the way for integration into developer tools and IDEs

### **Data Engineer Intern – ESPRIT School of Engineering, Tunisia**  
**June 2023 – Sep 2023**  

Worked on building a small-scale data pipeline to help the university analyze student performance and attendance trends. Focused on collecting, cleaning, and structuring data from existing sources for reporting purposes.

Key Contributions:

-Data Extraction: Collected student grades, attendance, and course info from Excel files and Moodle exports.

-Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used Python (Pandas) to handle missing values, normalize formats, and merge datasets.

-Database Setup: Created a simple PostgreSQL database to store processed data for easy querying.

-Basic Analytics: Generated summary statistics (average grades, attendance rates) to identify trends and patterns.

-Reporting: Built basic visualizations with Matplotlib / Power BI to support faculty understanding of student performance.

Impact:
Helped the faculty quickly identify students at risk, track course performance trends, and make informed decisions, while gaining hands-on experience in data engineering fundamentals and ETL workflows
